##

Pathogens that escape from phagosome, like Listeria and Rickettsia, are processed by, instead of lysosomes, proteasome.

##

Macrophage has CD14 which binds to LPS.

NK has CD16 which binds to IgG FC and cause ADCC.

B7 IS THE SAME AS CD80CD86; these activate T CD28. CTLA4 completes with CD28 for the binding.

##

Capsules are negatively charged, repelling phagocyte negative surface.
Capsules are hydrophobic, making engulfing difficult.
Capsules hide antigens targetted by the Igs.

C3 lands on capsule, without any removal, amplifies, and runs the alternate complement pathway, leading to important MAC.

10% lymphocyte = NK

NK.perforins >> hole
NK.granzymes >> hole >> apoptosis
NK.CD56 OR .CD16

(IFg, IL12) >>> NK

NK >> KILL Low MHC1 Cell

OR, the Macs (with CD16) can directly bind to IgGo
Too much? Serum sickness.
